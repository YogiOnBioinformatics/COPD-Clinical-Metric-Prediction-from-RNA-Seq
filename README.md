# Linking COPD Clinical Metrics to RNA Sequencing 


Work done during 1st UVA BIMS PhD rotation with Professor Ani Manichaikul (July - August 2022).  
<br> 
Worked on prediction of COPD clinical metrics using bulk RNA-Seq data while accounting for several covariates in a systematic manner.

Linear Regression to model key lung function metrics based on expression levels using `MESA` participants and determining significant genes when accounting for covariates.

<b>Overall model</b>: 

```
Lung Volume Metric ~ Specific Gene Expression Level + PEER factors + Principal Components 1-11 from WGS data + Phenotypic covariates
```
